# MUSE Portal

Mining and Understanding Software Enclaves (MUSE) seeks to make significant advances in the way software is built, debugged, verified, maintained and understood. 

Central to its approach is the creation of a community infrastructure built around a large, diverse and evolving corpus of software drawn from the hundreds of billions of lines of open source code available today.

# Helicon

Helicon represents the underlying infrastructure needed to gather, filter, and analyze open source software projects for the MUSE program. 

The main components of the Helicon mining pipeline are located in the graphql directory. The graphql directory contains it's own readme on the specific components, environment configurations, and execution.
